## üìä **The Complete Story**

### **1. THE PROBLEM (CHAOS DISCOVERED)**
- 35% of customers had multiple accounts (up to 7 different profiles)
- Legacy rules-based system only caught exact matches
- $2M annual revenue loss from poor personalization
- High-value customers were most affected

### **2. THE SOLUTION (ML INNOVATION)**
- **Multi-tower neural networks** creating 128-dimensional behavioral embeddings
- **Three-layer matching system:**
  - Layer 1: Exact matches (traditional rules)
  - Layer 2: Embedding similarity (cosine similarity > 0.85)
  - Layer 3: Hybrid model (XGBoost combining features)
- **150+ behavioral features:** purchase patterns, seasonal trends, geographic data

### **3. THE IMPACT (BUSINESS RESULTS)**
- **23% improvement** in customer identification accuracy (68% ‚Üí 91%)
- **30% more training data** by connecting anonymous sessions
- **40 days ahead of schedule** through agile development
- **$2M+ annual revenue impact** from improved personalization
- **Scalable foundation** for future ML innovations

## üîç **Common Interview Questions**

**Q: How would this scale to millions of customers?**
A: Implement approximate nearest neighbors (FAISS/Annoy), batch processing, and real-time APIs with caching.

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: Three-tier confidence system: auto-merge (90%+), human review (75-90%), keep separate (<75%).

**Q: Why embeddings over traditional matching?**
A: Embeddings capture behavioral patterns that persist across name changes, email updates, and life events.
