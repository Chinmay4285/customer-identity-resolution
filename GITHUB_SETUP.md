# ðŸš€ Push to Private GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create Private Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+" icon** in top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill out the form:
   - **Repository name:** `customer-identity-resolution`
   - **Description:** `ML system achieving 31% accuracy improvement and $2M revenue impact`
   - **Visibility:** âœ… **Private** (IMPORTANT!)
   - **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\chinm\Desktop\Projects\Customer Identity Resolution"

# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/customer-identity-resolution.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. **Verify it shows as "Private"** in the repository header

## Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it)

```bash
cd "C:\Users\chinm\Desktop\Projects\Customer Identity Resolution"

# Create private repository and push (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
gh repo create customer-identity-resolution --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Your Repository Will Include:

âœ… **Customer_Identity_Final_Demo.py** - Main demo file
âœ… **Customer Identity resolution.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook
âœ… **PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Interview preparation
âœ… **README.md** - Complete project overview
âœ… **All supporting files** - Working versions and documentation

## ðŸ”’ Privacy Confirmed

## Next Steps After Upload:

1. **Share repository access** with interviewers if requested
2. **Clone on other machines** for practice:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/customer-identity-resolution.git
   ```
3. **Update repository** as you improve the code:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated analysis and visualizations"
